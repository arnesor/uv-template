# Contributor Guide

Thank you for your interest in improving this project.
This project is open-source under the [{{cookiecutter.license.replace("-", " ")}} license] and
welcomes contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

Here is a list of important resources for contributors:

- [Source Code]
- [Issue Tracker]
- [Code of Conduct]

## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.12+ and [uv]:

1. Install [uv] if you haven't already. Refer to the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
2. Synchronize the development virtual environment and dependencies:

   ```console
   uv sync --all-extras
   ```

3. Install the pre-commit hooks:

   ```console
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

You can now run an interactive Python session, or your app:

```console
uv run python
uv run {{cookiecutter.project_name}}
```

## How to test the project

We run several types of checks on the codebase.

### Run Unit Tests

Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory and are written using the [pytest] testing framework. Run them with coverage:

```console
uv run pytest
```

### Run Type Checking

Type check the source files and tests using [mypy]:

```console
uv run mypy src tests
```

### Run Linting & Formatting

Check for lint errors and formatting using [ruff]:

```console
uv run ruff check
uv run ruff format --check
```

To automatically format the code and fix auto-fixable lint issues:

```console
uv run ruff check --fix
uv run ruff format
```

### Run Documentation Examples Check

Run doctests using [xdoctest]:

```console
uv run python -m xdoctest --modname={{cookiecutter.package_name}} --command=all
```

### Run Runtime Typeguard Checks

Check type compliance at runtime:

```console
uv run pytest --typeguard-packages={{cookiecutter.package_name}}
```

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.

Feel free to submit early, though—we can always iterate on this.

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
